[link to the article](https://www.developer-tech.com/news/top-5-ai-tools-for-frontend-development/).


In this article, the author highlights five AI tools that are transforming how developers approach frontend development in 2025. These tools, such as GitHub Copilot, AutonomyAI, Cursor, Google Stitch, and Locofy.ai, help engineers save time, boost productivity, and focus more on improving user experience rather than repetitive coding. 
 
I found the article informative, especially because it introduced me to tools I hadn’t heard of before, like Locofy.ai. While tools like Copilot and Cursor are widely known, learning about Locofy.ai made me realize just how far AI has come in automating frontend workflows. Honestly, it raised some concerns about the future of frontend roles. It’s exciting from a stakeholder or designer perspective as anyone can potentially generate a fully functional website from a design with minimal coding effort. However, from a developer's point of view, it does make me wonder how much of our work might eventually be replaced or reshaped. 
 
That said, I still think these tools can be powerful allies. Used thoughtfully, they can free up time to work on creative, high-impact aspects of UI/UX instead of boilerplate implementation.

I agree with the article and Iva on the idea that AI tools are transforming how developers are approaching frontend development and coding in general. I was resistant to using AI tools initially because I was worried that they might produce low-quality or incorrect code. However, after experimenting with a few, I found that in the correct hands, they can help any developer become more efficient and effective allowing them more time to focus on more complex problems. Of course, it’s still important to review and test any AI-generated code to ensure it meets quality standards.
